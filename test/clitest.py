"""
TestSuite and Test objects and some helper functions for running simple tests
on command line programs.

Tries to do a lot and not too much while providing simple clean output for
test results. Uses ansi color codes to color the output. This will make test
output hard to read on terminals that do not support them.

Lots of different kind of tests that feed a command line program some input and
expect some output can be run with these tools. However, it is likely that some
things will need to be adjusted. The test suite has been written with a lot of
small methods that are called by other methods. This gives it a bit of a
template pattern to replace any little peice as needed. This may be to read
input or output differently or to perform a different check to determine
success or failure or to add new data and operations while keeping the same
general pattern. The helper functions are also separate and not TestSuite
methods to allow their use in different ways without always subclassing
TestSuite. To see some project specific uses see the lieutenant-64 repository.

TODO Make this it's own project and repo. Then add some examples of how it
could be used to test certain kinds of program and maybe some simple extensions
to cover common use cases not covered by the base class.

### Test classes #############################################################

# TODO implement behaviour for show_line_diff=True
class TestSuite:
    """A collection of tests for a command line program that will be run
    as a group.

    Takes a test suite name, a command for the command line program to run for
    each test, and a list of tests.

    The input to the program defaults to stdin, but program_source can be
    passed a file name to read the input to pass to the program under test's
    subprocess. In a similar way program output can specify where to expect
    the actual output. If it is stdout the programs output will be read from
    stdout. If it is a filename that file will be read instead.

    input_is_file tells the test suite that the program under test expects to
    read from a file instead of being given input. If this is true then
    program source must be set as the filename and any program input will be
    written to that file so the program under test can use it to get test
    input.

    expected_is_file tells the test suite that the expected output needs to be
    read from a file. This might be handy if the expected output is very large
    and it is impractical to specify it in a string when creating the Test
    object.

    print_end_info will tell the suite that when it is finished running it
    should display some information about the run of the suite. If this is
    true and reprint_failed is true then each failed test will be reprinted
    after the tests have all finished running.

    show_fail_info specifies that when a test fails a verbose output of
    failure information should be printed. This might contain error information
    and will always contain the expected output vs the actual output.

    show_line_diff(unimplemented) is indended to give a view of the difference
    between the expected and actual instead of printing them completely.
    However it has not been setup yet.
